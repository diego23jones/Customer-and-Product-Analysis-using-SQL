The goal of this project is to analyze data from a sales records database for scale model cars and extract information for decision-making. 
The specific questions I intended to answer were:

Question 1) Which products should we order more of or less of?
Question 2) How should we tailor marketing and communication strategies to customer behaviors?
Question 3) How much can we spend on acquiring new customers?

Database contains 8 tables:
1)	Customers: customer data
2)	Employees: all employee information
3)	Offices: sales office information
4)	Orders: customers' sales orders
5)	OrderDetails: sales order line for each sales order
6)	Payments: customers' payment records
7)	Products: a list of scale model cars
8)	ProductLines: a list of product line categories
