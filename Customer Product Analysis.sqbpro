</sql><sql name="Conclusion">/* Conclusion with answers to questions

Q1) Which products should we order more of or less of?

	Vintage cars and motorcycles are the priority for restocking as the data shows they sell very frequently and are also
	the highest performing products.

Q2) How should we match marketing and communication straegies to customer behaviors?

	Since VIP customers and lesser engaged customers have been identifed, detrmining how to drive loyalty and attract
	more customers is simple. 

	For VIP customers, the strategy should be to build on their existing loyalty by using highly personalized 
	communications and giving these customers certain exclusive benefits. VIP customers should be approached
	in a way that leaves them feeling appreciated and encourages them to continue their high level of engagement.

	For the lesser engaged customers, the focus should be on education and re-engagement. This can be done through
	clear and accessible messaging that emphasizes the benefits of the companies offerings, possibly with incentives
	or offers to encourage renewed interest in the company. By analyzing behavior patterns trust can be built and 
	these customers will gradually shift towwards a more engaged relationship with the company.
	
Q3) How much can we spend on acquiring new customers?
	
	The LTV value for the VIPS was 39039.5943877551, the LTV tells us how much profit an average customer generates
	during their lifetime with the company. We can use this to predict future profits, so, if 10 new customers are acquired
	we predict $390,395 will be earned. We can decide based upon this prediction how much to spend on acquirning new 
	customers.
